# LangChain Summary for Kilo Code

This document provides a high-level overview of the LangChain framework, instructions for integration, and other important details to help Kilo Code use this library effectively.

## a) High-Level Explanation

**LangChain** is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It simplifies the entire lifecycle of LLM application development, from development and productionization to deployment.

### Key Concepts:

*   **Components:** LangChain provides modular components, such as LLM wrappers, prompt templates, and output parsers, which can be combined to create powerful applications.
*   **Chains:** Chains are sequences of components that allow for more complex application logic.
*   **Agents:** Agents use an LLM to decide which actions to take, making them suitable for more dynamic applications.
*   **LangGraph:** A library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, using a graph-based approach.

### Architecture:

The LangChain framework is composed of several packages:

*   `langchain-core`: Contains the base abstractions for all LangChain components.
*   `langchain`: Includes the chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that form the cognitive architecture of an application.
*   **Integration Packages** (e.g., `langchain-openai`, `langchain-anthropic`): Provide integrations with third-party services.
*   `langchain-community`: Contains community-maintained third-party integrations.
*   `langgraph`: An extension for building stateful, multi-actor applications.
*   `langserve`: A package for deploying LangChain chains as REST APIs.

## b) Instructions for Integrating with LangChain

Integrating with LangChain typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Installation:** Install the necessary LangChain packages using pip. The core package is `langchain`, and individual integration packages are also available (e.g., `langchain-openai`).

    ```bash
    pip install langchain langchain-openai
    ```

2.  **Set Up Environment Variables:** Most integrations require API keys, which should be set as environment variables. For example, to use OpenAI, you would set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable.

3.  **Import and Use Components:** Import the desired components from the LangChain libraries and use them to build your application.

### Example: Using the OpenAI Chat Model

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Initialize the chat model
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0)

# Invoke the model with a prompt
response = llm.invoke("Tell me a joke.")

print(response)
```

## c) Core Modules

Here is a list of the core modules provided by LangChain, along with a description of when to use them. This will help you know what to search for in the Context7 MCP server.

*   **Agents**: Use agents when you need to give an LLM access to tools and have it decide which tools to call to accomplish a task. LangGraph is the recommended way to build agents.
*   **Chat Models**: These are wrappers around LLMs that expose a chat interface (taking a list of messages and returning a message). This is the primary way to interact with LLMs in LangChain.
*   **Document Loaders**: Use these to load documents from various sources (e.g., text files, PDFs, Notion, etc.) into a standardized format.
*   **Embedding Models**: These models transform text into numerical vectors (embeddings). This is essential for semantic search and other retrieval tasks.
*   **Output Parsers**: These are used to structure the output of an LLM. For example, you can use an output parser to get a JSON object from an LLM.
*   **Prompt Templates**: These help to create and reuse prompts for LLMs. They allow you to dynamically insert values into your prompts.
*   **Retrievers**: These are used to fetch relevant documents for a given query. They are often used in conjunction with vector stores.
*   **Text Splitters**: Use these to split long documents into smaller chunks. This is important for processing large documents with LLMs that have a limited context window.
*   **Tools**: Tools are functions that an agent can call. They can be anything from a simple function to a complex integration with an external API.
*   **Vector Stores**: These are databases that store and search for vector embeddings. They are a key component of most retrieval-based applications.

## d) Other Details for Kilo Code

*   **Asynchronous Support:** LangChain provides asynchronous support for most of its components, which is crucial for building scalable applications.
*   **Streaming:** LangChain supports streaming, allowing you to process and display the output of an LLM as it's being generated.
*   **LangSmith:** LangSmith is a platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring your LLM applications. It's an invaluable tool for moving from prototype to production.
*   **Community and Documentation:** LangChain has a large and active community, and the official documentation is an excellent resource for learning more about the framework.

This summary should provide Kilo Code with a solid foundation for working with LangChain. For more detailed information, refer to the official LangChain documentation using the Context7 MCP (specifically, this library: https://context7.com/langchain-ai/langchain).
