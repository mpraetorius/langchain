# Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on the initial setup and definition of the Memory Bank. The primary goal is to establish a robust and accurate set of documentation that will guide all future research and reporting tasks.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the Memory Bank by creating the core documentation files.
- Defined the project's purpose, goals, and workflow in `product.md`.
- Clarified and agreed upon the report structure and content with the user.

## Next Steps
- Complete the creation of all core Memory Bank files (`architecture.md`, `tech.md`).
- Conduct a thorough analysis of the LangChain repository to populate the `architecture.md` and `tech.md` files with accurate information.
- Receive the first research topic from the user.
