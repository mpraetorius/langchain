## Why This Project Exists
This project exists to create a research assistant that assists a primary AI coding agent. Its purpose is to offload the cognitive burden of repository-wide research from the coding agent.

## Problems It Solves
- **Limited Context Window:** AI coding agents have a finite context window. Pre-researching and summarizing information on specific topics allows the coding agent to focus its context on the immediate implementation task.
- **Redundant Research:** Prevents the coding agent from repeatedly analyzing the same sections of a large codebase for different tasks.
- **Efficiency:** Saves time and computational resources (tokens) by providing the coding agent with a pre-digested, relevant summary instead of requiring it to parse an entire repository.

## How It Should Work
The research assistant operates based on a defined workflow:
1.  The user provides a specific research topic related to the LangChain repository.
2.  The assistant clarifies any ambiguities in the request.
3.  It conducts a thorough analysis of the entire repository to gather all relevant information.
4.  It synthesizes this information into a concise, factual, and comprehensive report.
5.  The final report is delivered to the user, ready to be consumed by the AI coding agent.

## User Experience Goals
- **Clarity:** The reports generated must be unambiguous and easy for an AI agent to parse.
- **Completeness:** The reports should be self-contained, providing all necessary information for the coding agent to complete its task without needing to perform additional research.
- **Reliability:** The process should be consistent and repeatable, ensuring high-quality outputs for every request.
